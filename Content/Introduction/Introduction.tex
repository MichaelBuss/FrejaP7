    %Global drug delivery is not great
    %targeted drug delivery
    %bio-compatibility
    %monodispersed droplets
    %microfluidics is a good candidate


%Drug delivery 
    %uptake of drugs in cells
    
%Hydrogel particles (Freja)
    %General information on hydrogels and their drug delivery properties (Hydrogel droplets for drug delivery - targeted delivery)
    %Stability of Hydrogel particles 
    %Cross-linking of hydrogels
    %Loading cargo in hydrogel particles
    %Gelatin hydrogel (Freja)
        %Gelatin as a hydrogel material (stability, biocompatibility, critical gelation concentration, and cross-linking) - maybe some of it in stoa

%Droplet generation (MARZIA)
