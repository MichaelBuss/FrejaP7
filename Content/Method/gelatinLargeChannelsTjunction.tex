For the dispersed phase of the droplet generator gelatin was dissolved in phosphate buffer at 40\si{\degreeCelsius} while stirring obtaining a 5wt\% 5mL solution. 
For the continuous phase a 0.01wt\% solution of sorbitane monooleate in grape seed oil was prepared. Furthermore an outlet solution containing 10 mL grape seed oil and 152 $\mu$L glutaraldehyd (25\%) was prepared. %76\muLx4 2x76\muL

In order to generate droplets the dispersed and continuous phase were propelled through a T-junction at 25 and 50 $\mu$L/min respectively, and collected into the outlet solution while stirred. During the procedure the dispersed phase was kept at 40\si{\degreeCelsius}. The gelatin particle solution was kept at 4\si{\degreeCelsius} overnight while stirred. The particles were purified via centrifugation and resuspension in acetone and phosphate buffer and finally stored in phosphate buffer.
