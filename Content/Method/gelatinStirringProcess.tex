\section{Preparation of Gelatin Particles}
Gelatin was dissolved in 10 mL phosphate buffer at 40\si{\degreeCelsius} while stirring yielding a 5wt\% solution. To form the particles solution was the added to 100 mL paraffin oil along with surfactant at 1400 rpm 4\si{\degreeCelsius}. To enable cross-linking 70\si{\uL} glutaraldehyde was added dropwise afterwhich the solution was stirred rapidly at 20 000 rpm for ten minutes. The solution was kept at 4\si{\degreeCelsius} overnight while stirred. 
The gelatin particle solution was purified via centrifuging and resuspending twice in acetone and twice phosphate buffer. The particles were stored in phosphate buffer at 4\si{\degreeCelsius}. Samples for light microscopy was prepared both before and after cleaning the particles.
